# 50.045 Information Retrieval : Image Search IR System

The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly search platform for speakers of all languages and ages by using images as the search query.

Input: An image representing the query
Output: Images that are visually similar to the query

To run the barebones GUI, `pip install streamlit`, then `streamlit run image_searcher_gui.py`. However, since the models directly draw images from the dataset, and they are not included in this repository, this GUi cannot really be used.
